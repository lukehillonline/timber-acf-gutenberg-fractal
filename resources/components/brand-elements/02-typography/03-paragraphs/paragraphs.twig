<p class="align-left">Water is a transparent, tasteless, odorless, and nearly colorless chemical substance, which is the
    main constituent of Earth&#39;s streams, lakes, and oceans, and  the fluids of most living organisms. It is vital
    for all known forms of life, even though  it provides no calories or organic nutrients. Its chemical formula is H2O,
    meaning that each of its molecules contains one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms, connected by covalent bonds. Water is
    the name of the liquid state of H2O at standard ambient temperature and pressure. It forms precipitation in the form
    of rain and aerosols in  the form of fog. Clouds are formed from suspended droplets of water and ice, its solid
    state. When finely divided, crystalline ice may precipitate in the form of snow. The gaseous state of water is steam
    or water vapor. Water moves continually through  the water cycle of evaporation, transpiration (evapotranspiration),
    condensation, precipitation, and runoff, usually reaching the sea.</p>
